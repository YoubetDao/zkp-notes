## Introduction

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) are cryptographic protocols that allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. ZKPs are pivotal in enhancing privacy and security in various applications, including blockchain, authentication systems, and more.

This repository is intended to serve as a comprehensive guide to understanding ZKPs, from the basic principles to advanced implementations. The notes provided here are designed to be easy to follow, with explanations, examples, and references to further reading.
